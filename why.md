# Why we have halted the Popcorn Kernel and the website is down.

## Halted Development

Reason is LisieDoesCode doesn't have a powerful enough computer to continue coding and building it when the project gets bigger
and MrMasterKeyboard doesn't have a backup computer powerful enough if his main PC goes down. We also don't have any idea on what to add
as we are so early in development. We honestly can't code much right now as we aren't experienced in coding but have some knowledge.

## Website Down

The excuse behind this is that we don't want a github domain, we need a normal domain but we have tried a lot of things and nothing works.
The website is also down until we get a proper solution up.

All of this doesn't mean we are going quiet and disappearing never to be heard from again but Popcorn is expected to resume some time around December and the website, we don't know when but soon.

### Thanks for your cooperation.
